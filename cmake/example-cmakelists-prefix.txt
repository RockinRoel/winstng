# This is the example's CMakeLists.txt, prefixed with the required
# configuration settings to allow building the examples of the
# binary Wt distribution as a standalone project.
#
# This CMakeLists.txt is complex because it supports all different modes
# of building Wt on all supported platforms. Your own CMakeLists.txt can
# be much simpler. For example:
#
# CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.4)
# Project(myproject)
# 
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(c:/wt-installation-path/include)
# LINK_DIRECTORIES(c:/wt-installation-path/lib)
# 
# ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DHPDF_DLL)
#
# ADD_EXECUTABLE(myprog.wt
#   MyProg1.cpp
#   OtherFile.cpp
#   AndEvenMoreCode.cpp
# )
#
# TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myprog.wt
#   debug wtd      optimized wt
#   debug wthttpd  optimized wthttp
#   debug libhpdfd optimized libhpdf # only required for if you write pdfs
# )
